Getting and Cleaning Data : Course Project 

Repository for all code written for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

Course Project Requirements.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to run.

1.Download and extract data source from (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into working directory of R studio in local drive.

2.Ensure "run_analysis.R" is in the working directory of the extracted data source

3.Execute the run_analysis.R script.

After the execution of the script, it will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.
